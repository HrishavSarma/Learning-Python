# Polymorphism -> Greek word that means to "have many faces or forms"
#                 Poly -> many
#                 morph -> form

#                 Two ways to polymorphism
#                 1 Inheritance -> An object could be treated of the same type as a parent class
#                 2 "Duck Typing" -> Object must have necessary attributes/methods

#                 1 Inheritance:
